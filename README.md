# Movers and Forces

## Pre-reads

[Chapter 1. Vectors](https://nature-of-code-2nd-edition.netlify.app/vectors/) and [Chapter 2. Forces](https://nature-of-code-2nd-edition.netlify.app/force/) from [_Nature of Code (2nd Edition)_](https://nature-of-code-2nd-edition.netlify.app/)

## This Code

Included here is a bare-bones version of the `Mover` class described in Chapter 1, already pre-linked. The code includes some potentially novel JavaScript usage, so make sure you check it out, but it is largely what is found both in Chapter 1 and the 201 lab. 

## Your objectives

1. update the `Mover` class to accomodate the concepts of _mass_ and _acceleration_, as well as a way to apply external forces to a `Mover` (this is described in Chapter 2).
2. update your code to include at least one interactive element that applies a force to the movers in your code. There are several examples provided.
3. update the code visually so that your forces make sense. For instance, if you were going to model the solar system, make it look like the solar system.
